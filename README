BUILDING THE APPLICATION
------------------------
To compile the application, first make sure you have installed the Xerox tools
from http://www.stanford.edu/~laurik/fsmbook/home.html and that they are in
your path. Then execute the command make in the application's root directory.
The transducer can then be tested by invoking ``xfst -s latin.fst'' and using
the up and down commands to analyse and generate, respectively.

There are a number of tests available as well, to make sure the code works
properly. The tests in t/99-proiel-bg.t and t/99-proiel-vulgata.t are expected
to have a number of failures (about 80 and 160, respectively); this test code
is automatically generated, and some of these errors are legitimate bugs,
while a few are errors in the annotation and the rest missing lemmata that
happen to have identical forms as lemmata we already handle. Running the test
suite requires:
- The XFSM Python bindings (available from the same place as the
- The prove program from the Perl module Test::Harness (which should be
  installed with your system Perl).
