BUILDING THE APPLICATION
------------------------
To compile the application, first make sure you have installed the Xerox tools
from http://www.stanford.edu/~laurik/fsmbook/home.html and that they are in
your path. Then execute the command make in the application's root directory.
The transducer can then be tested by invoking ``xfst -s latin.fst'' and using
the up and down commands to analyse and generate, respectively.

The test suite can be invoked by executing the command ``make test'', however
UiO's default linux has an outdated version of Python installed in the default
location (/usr/bin/python) which causes problems with the Python interface to
xfsm. To run the test suite on these systems, try the command ``prove -r
--perl /local/bin/python t/''.
