BUILDING THE APPLICATION
------------------------
To compile the application, first make sure you have installed the Xerox tools
from http://www.stanford.edu/~laurik/fsmbook/home.html and that they are in
your path. Then execute the command make in the application's root directory.
The transducer can then be tested by invoking ``xfst -s latin.fst'' and using
the up and down commands to analyse and generate, respectively.

There are a number of tests available as well, to make sure the code works
properly. The tests in t/99-proiel-bg.t and t/99-proiel-vulgata.t are expected
to have a number of failures (about 6700 and 16000, respectively); this test
code is automatically generated, and we're working on a way to mark them as
TODO to eliminate the noise in the test output. Any other failures are
legitimate bugs that have to be fixed. Running the test suite requires:
- The XFSM Python bindings (available from the same place as the
  libraries themself)
- The pyTAP library, available from https://github.com/rjbs/pytap
- The prove program from the Perl module Test::Harness (which should be
  installed with your system Perl).
