Things TODO:
============
- Add multicharacter symbol declarations.
- Figure out some sane way to share Multicharacter_symbols defs between
  lexicon files.
- Write a filter to create lexc code from lewis.xml from Perseus.
- For all of the above, essentially: figure out a reasonably sane way to build
  the lexc sources from other bits and pieces, some hand-written, some
  auto-generated.
- Read up and figure out how to represent non-concatenative features.
