Things TODO:
============
- Figure out some sane way to share Multicharacter_symbols defs between
  lexicon files. gcc -E perhaps?
- Write a filter to create lexc code from lewis.xml from Perseus.
- For all of the above, essentially: figure out a reasonably sane way to build
  the lexc sources from other bits and pieces, some hand-written, some
  auto-generated.
- Refine the v-drop rules, according to Ernout.
- Add supines, participles and gerunds to the nouns file. Supines could go in
  the verbs file, but since they're formed from the same stem as some of the
  participles it's easier to add them to the nouns file. Gerunds, OTOH, would
  be nice to have in the verbs file, but with nominal inflection added; but
  I'm not sure if the phonetic rules might come and bite me in the ass if I do
  that. Although, if all of them are dependent on the morpheme boundary
  character (-), it might be ok, since the nominal system doesn't involve that
  particular character. If that works out, "templating" might be as simple as
  keeping stuff in different files and stuffing them together with cat(1).
- Ref. Dag, perhaps add section comparing the synchronous rules I have
  implemented with the actual diachronous developments of the morphology (see
  Meillet).
- Comment and document the code.
- Write tests. They should be structured as a lexicon form paired to a list of
  correct forms. Testing should ensure that applying the lexicon form down
  produces the exact list of forms. As many forms as possible should be
  tested.
