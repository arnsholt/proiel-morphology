Things TODO:
============
- Move report to Norwegian.
- Figure out some sane way to share Multicharacter_symbols defs between
  lexicon files.
- Write a filter to create lexc code from lewis.xml from Perseus.
- For all of the above, essentially: figure out a reasonably sane way to build
  the lexc sources from other bits and pieces, some hand-written, some
  auto-generated.
- Write a simple (SIMPLE!) interface to the analysis engine via Python.
- The phonetic rules need to know when an u is a vowel and when it's a consonant.
- Figure out how to write a phonetic rule that correctly models the
  v-epenthesis style perfects. (OMGWTFBBQ, this is kinda hard...)
