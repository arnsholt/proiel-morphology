Things TODO:
============
- Write a filter to create lexc code from lewis.xml from Perseus.
- Comment and document the code.
- Add morpheme boundaries to all morphemes in nouns-lexc.txt.
- Find a way to handle/generate ambiguous gender tags.
  - Represent them (and only them) in the grammar, and add gender-bender
    regexes to create unambiguous analyses?
  - Post-process analyses to synthesise ambiguous tags from unambiguous ones?
- Add tests for pronouns.
- PROIEL has derived adverbs as belonging to their own lemma (longe not from
  longus, for example), while I have them belonging to the adjective root.
  This should be fixed.
- meus, tuus, and friends have adverb derivations ATM. That should be fixed
  too. In conjunction with the above item probably.
