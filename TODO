Things TODO:
============
- Figure out some sane way to share Multicharacter_symbols defs between
  lexicon files. gcc -E perhaps?
- Write a filter to create lexc code from lewis.xml from Perseus.
- For all of the above, essentially: figure out a reasonably sane way to build
  the lexc sources from other bits and pieces, some hand-written, some
  auto-generated.
- Refine the v-drop rules, according to Ernout.
- Ref. Dag, perhaps add section comparing the synchronous rules I have
  implemented with the actual diachronous developments of the morphology (see
  Meillet).
- Comment and document the code.
- Add morpheme boundaries to all morphemes in nouns-lexc.txt.
- Apparently longus+Adj+Super+Adv is legal. Fix.
