Things TODO:
============
- Figure out some sane way to share Multicharacter_symbols defs between
  lexicon files. gcc -E perhaps? Or maybe even bite the dust and use m4?
- Write a filter to create lexc code from lewis.xml from Perseus.
- For all of the above, essentially: figure out a reasonably sane way to build
  the lexc sources from other bits and pieces, some hand-written, some
  auto-generated.
- Comment and document the code.
- Add morpheme boundaries to all morphemes in nouns-lexc.txt.
- Find a way to handle/generate ambiguous gender tags.
  - Represent them (and only them) in the grammar, and add gender-bender
    regexes to create unambiguous analyses?
  - Post-process analyses to synthesise ambiguous tags from unambiguous ones?
- Add tests for pronouns.
