Things TODO:
============
- Move report to Norwegian.
- Add multicharacter symbol declarations.
- Figure out some sane way to share Multicharacter_symbols defs between
  lexicon files.
- Write a filter to create lexc code from lewis.xml from Perseus.
- For all of the above, essentially: figure out a reasonably sane way to build
  the lexc sources from other bits and pieces, some hand-written, some
  auto-generated.
- Read up and figure out how to represent non-concatenative features.
- More complexity. The lexc could should output forms like ama-o (for amo) or
  ama-b-ris (for amaberis), on top of that we add another set of rules
  (written in xfst or twolc) that take care of the transformation from morph
  lists to correct forms. This will probably require more thinking, but should
  also give a conceptually cleaner result (I hope).

  The final transducer should be: [ Lexicon .o. Phonology ]
